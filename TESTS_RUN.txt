Test 1: Proof of concept
-- pop = 50
-- generations = 100
-- num_eval = 30
-- low mutation
Notes: Good improvement over generations, but doesnt seems to have converged yet. Next run, try higher mutation

Test 2:
-- pop = 50
-- gen = 100
-- numeval = 30
-- high mutation amount and rate
Notes: Increased both mutation amount and rate. However, this resulted in poor performance. Fitness pretty much stayed the same over generations. We decided that the mutation amount was too big -> next run reduce to test 1 quantities.

Test 3:
-- pop = 30
-- gen = 200
-- numeval = 30
-- low mutation amount, higher rate
Notes: Good performance.
Audio file: Despite high fitness, audio output is not as clear.

Test 4:
-- pop 30
-- gen = 200
-- numeval = 100
-- same mutation as test 3
Notes: We wanted to see if increasing num eval would improve performance of ENN.
Also, Sherri mentioned that lower pop would work going forward.
Audio file: Audio output file is noticeably better. We should use even higher numeval going foward.

Test 5:
-- pop 15
-- gen 43
-- numeval = 300
-- same mutation..?
-- L = 1024, C = 1 (increased L from previous runs)
-- different data (violin_full.wav and piano_full.wav)
-- time:

Test 6:
-- pop 30
-- gen 100
-- little more elitism 3
-- numeval = 115
-- increasing weight_mutate_rate (keep amount low) from 0.5 to 0.55
-- time: 960 seconds
-- We decided not to increase C, L

Test 7 (choe):
-- pop 15
-- gen 50
-- numeval = 200
-- Notes: We reduced L back to 512 due to runtime concerns. This is essentially test 4 but with more numeval and larger test set. Also reduced gen and pop. We fixed a bug regarding numeval we caused previous tests to eval much less than expected.
-- time: 575s per generation

Test 8 (liy):
-- pop 15
-- gen 50
-- numeval = 200
-- Notes: This is with recurrent network (compare with test 7)
-- time: 350s per generation1

Test 9 (liy):
