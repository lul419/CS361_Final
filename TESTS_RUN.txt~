Test 1: Proof of concept
-- pop = 50
-- generations = 100
-- num_eval = 30
-- low mutation
Notes: Good improvement over generations, but doesnt seems to have converged yet. Next run, try higher mutation

Test 2:
-- pop = 50
-- gen = 100
-- numeval = 30
-- high mutation amount and rate
Notes: Increased both mutation amount and rate. However, this resulted in poor performance. Fitness pretty much stayed the same over generations. We decided that the mutation amount was too big -> next run reduce to test 1 quantities.

Test 3:
-- pop = 30
-- gen = 200
-- numeval = 30
-- low mutation amount, higher rate
Notes: Good performance.

Test 4:
-- pop 30
-- gen = 200
-- numeval = 100
-- same mutation as test 3
Notes: We wanted to see if increasing num eval would improve performance of ENN.
Also, Sherri mentioned that lower pop would work going forward.
